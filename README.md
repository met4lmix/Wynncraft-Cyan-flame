> **Note**

- Make sure to place it on top of the server pack for it to work (require [Server Pack Unlocker](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-pack-unlocker) or [Serverpack Priority](https://modrinth.com/mod/serverpack-priority))
- If blocks do not glow (because of **Sodium**), you will need [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) with **_Emissive ON_**.
- For the **smaller-fire** version, you can use it without the **main** version.
